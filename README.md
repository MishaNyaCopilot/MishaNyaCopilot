I'm a Python Developer specializing in building intelligent, scalable, and high-performance backend systems. My passion lies at the intersection of AI, microservices, and practical problem-solving.

I'm a strong advocate for AI-augmented development. I actively leverage modern AI tools throughout the entire development lifecycle—from architectural design to coding, refactoring, and debugging. This approach allows me to build and ship robust, valuable products faster.

### 🚀 Featured Project Spotlight: @WhisperTranscriber_bot

My most significant personal project is **[@WhisperTranscriber_bot](https://t.me/WhisperTranscriber_bot)**, a Telegram bot for AI-powered audio transcription that I built from the ground up. It's a great example of my engineering and product philosophy.

*   **Scale & Impact:** Grew organically from a personal tool to a service trusted by **30,000+ users**, handling approximately **1,000 transcriptions daily**.
*   **Architecture Evolution:** To handle the growing load, I re-architected the system from a simple monolith to a scalable **microservices architecture** using FastAPI, RabbitMQ, and horizontally-scaled workers.
*   **Product & Monetization:** Implemented a full-featured monetization system using **Telegram Stars**, complete with a smart **anti-scam refund protection** mechanism to prevent abuse of the service.
*   **Technology:** The core is built with Python, running on a stack that includes `python-telegram-bot`, `FastAPI`, `Whisper AI`, `PostgreSQL`, and `Redis`.

### 💻 Professional Experience & Tech Stack

In my professional work, I've delivered robust backend solutions for clients, focusing on automation and AI-driven analytics. My goal is always to build reliable systems that solve real business problems.

Key project areas include:
*   **AI-Powered Analytics:** Built an AI reputation monitoring system (`BadPressChecker`) that uses LLMs to detect and classify negative press online, providing clients with near-instant alerts.
*   **Business Process Automation:** Developed automated reporting systems for business analytics (e.g., from PBX data), drastically reducing time spent on manual data compilation from hours to minutes.
*   **Data Collection:** Created bots for SERP analytics to automate the collection and processing of search engine ranking data.

**My Core Tech Stack:**

*   **Languages:** Python, Kotlin, Go (learning)
*   **Backend:** FastAPI, Aiogram, `python-telegram-bot`, Microservices, REST API
*   **AI/ML:** LLMs (Ollama, OpenAI API), Prompt Engineering, RAG, Whisper AI
*   **Databases & Caching:** PostgreSQL, Redis, SQLAlchemy, Qdrant, MinIO
*   **DevOps & Tools:** Docker, Docker Compose, Git

### 🌱 I'm Currently Learning

I'm always looking to expand my skill set. Right now, I'm deepening my knowledge in **AWS** and **Kubernetes** to build even more high-performance, concurrent services.
